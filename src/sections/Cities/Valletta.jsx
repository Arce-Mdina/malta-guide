        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <div style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
          <p>
            Valletta's origins date back to the mid-16th century, 
            a time marked by intense conflict and strategic maneuvering
            in the Mediterranean. After the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, 
            in which the Knights of St. John successfully defended the island 
            against the Ottoman Empire, it became clear that a fortified city was 
            needed to safeguard Malta's strategic position. Grand Master Jean Parisot 
            de la Valette, the leader of the Knights, laid the first stone of the new city 
            in 1566, and Valletta was named in his honor.
          </p>

          <p>
            The city was meticulously planned by the 
            Italian military engineer Francesco Laparelli 
            and his assistant Gerolamo Cassar. Valletta was 
            designed as a grid, a novel concept at the time, 
            with wide streets to facilitate defense and movement. 
            Its construction was a monumental effort, involving extensive 
            labor to create the formidable fortifications that still stand today, 
            including bastions, curtain walls, and a deep moat.
